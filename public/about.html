<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>My name is Yile Li. I've had a unique educational journey that started with a Bachelor's in 
  Business Administration in China, where I developed my analytical and problem-solving skills. 
  My passion for language and communication led me to pursue a Master's in TESOL at NYU, deepening 
  my understanding of language and teaching. Now, I'm expanding my technical expertise with a Master's 
  in Computer Science at Northeastern University.

<p>I've always been drawn to bridging the gap between people and technology, which has driven my 
  diverse educational and professional journey. With a background that spans business management, 
  education, and now computer science, I've cultivated a unique blend of analytical and communication 
  skills that allow me to excel in both technical and team-oriented environments.
